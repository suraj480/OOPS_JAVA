# JAVA

## class
it is blue print of object

## Abstraction
To simplify reality and focus on the data and processess relevant to the application being built

## Polymorphism
Different subclassess of the same superclasss, can implement their shared interface in different ways

## Inheritance
A class can drive methods and properites from another class resulting in a hierarchy of classes

### Types of inheritance
1. single level inheritance
2. Multi level inheritance
3. Hierarchy level inheritance
4. Hybrid inheritance

## Encapsulation
Data and the program that manipulate those data are bound together and their complexity is hidden

# most important concept interface
## helps to take properties of two different class in our desired class and this is known as multiple inheritence
### interface implement (not extends) in interface u can not create non-abstract function and it can not have constructors
